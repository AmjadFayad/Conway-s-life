# Conway-s-life
A program that simulates a living group of cells. They are living in a two dimensional grid in which each square can take one of  two states, off or on (“dead” or “alive”). Each cell is identical and runs by the same rules. The rules are:  1. A living cell with only 0 or 1 living neighbours dies from isolation.  2. A living cell with 4 or more living neighbours dies from overcrowding.  3. A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbours becomes alive.  4. All other cells remain unchanged.  These rules are applied to all the cells simultaneously. Each time whole array is recalculated it is called a generation. The initial state should be read from a text file. The simulation should be visible on the screen
